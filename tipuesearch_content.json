Matthieu Ricard left no stone unturned in showing how fallacious we usually are in trying to defend ourselves on the unneccessary, massive killing and suffering of animals. Most of the \"reasons\" being used boil down to human chauvinism, the belief that because human is a superior specie (right in some senses), everything on earth should be used to serve human needs, even when that entails killing, or making animals suffer for our entertainment (wrong); and since humans are superior, moral rules begin and end with us, thus we are excluded from any moral obligations towards the animals (even more wrong).
