        <meta name="description" content="If you have ever experienced a data loss, you know how salvific backups are. They could save hours, if not weeks, of work, invalueable photos, critical documents, etc... Yet, a recent survey showed that more than 60% of computer users do not back up their data, or only do so no more than once every year. If you have never backed up your computer before in your life, or do not know how to do it, read on, you can save your future self from a headache to say the least in case your harddrive stops working on a random day, taking along with it all your precise data. While backing up your data on a yearly basis may be adequate for a bear to record his pre-hibernation diet, it&#39;s definitely recommendable to have a more frequently backup scheme. &#39;Frequently&#39; is the keyword here! Maybe you are aware of how important data protection is, but if you are like me and other mortal beings, then life is just too short to back up our harddrives properly. So, for us to backup our data often, we need a solution that is easy to use, requires as less interaction as possible, and ideally, can be put on auto-pilot. This is where CloneZilla comes into play." />
